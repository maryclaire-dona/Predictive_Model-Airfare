# Predictive_Model-Airfare

**Background**

The following problem takes place in the United States in the late 1990s, when
many major US cities were facing issues with airport congestion, partly as a result
of the 1978 deregulation of airlines. Both fares and routes were freed from
regulation, and low-fare carriers such as Southwest (SW) began competing on
existing routes and starting nonstop service on routes that previously lacked it.
Building completely new airports is generally not feasible, but sometimes
decommissioned military bases or smaller municipal airports can be reconfigured
as regional or larger commercial airports. There are numerous players and
interests involved in the issue (airlines, city, state and federal authorities, civic
groups, the military, airport operators), and an aviation consulting firm is seeking
advisory contracts with these players.
